## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- @dnd-kit for drag and drop
- Vite for build tooling

## Assumptions

1. Data Persistence:

   - Uses localStorage for data persistence
   - Initial data is loaded with sample tasks if no saved data exists

2. Task Management:

   - Tasks can only be created in the "Not Started" column
   - Tasks can be moved between any columns via drag and drop
   - Due dates are optional
   - Subtasks are predefined in the initial data and can be checked/unchecked (adding new subtasks is not supported in the current version)

3. UI/UX:

   - Column colors:
     - Not Started: Light grey
     - In Progress: Light grey
     - Blocked: Light red
     - Done: Light green
   - Due date colors:
     - Overdue: Light red
     - Due soon (â‰¤3 days): Light grey

## Implementation Details

The application follows a component-based architecture with the following main components:

- `KanbanBoard`: Main container component
- `Column`: Individual column component
- `Task`: Task card component with drag-and-drop
- `SubTask`: Subtask component with checkbox

Data management is handled through a custom hook that interfaces with localStorage for persistence.
